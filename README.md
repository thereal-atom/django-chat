# django-chat

very simple chat app made to learn django

at the moment it's basically as bare bones as it can be as I wanted to get it done in a couple of hours. as such, there's a list of features missing that I still do want to implement just not at the moment.

- [ ] proper user auth
- [ ] proper security
- [ ] speed optimizations (caching, more efficient code, etc)
- [ ] proper input validation
- [ ] improved project structure
- [ ] clean up code (centralized error handling, middleware to parse json properly, less repeated code, etc)
- [ ] next.js front end
